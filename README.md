# meScheduler
A School Scheduler and my first react app. trying to implement non-direct approach to support big school with more than 4 classes

## description ##
Well it's a mess right now the test case is hard-coded and I'm trying to solve it in a non-direct (recursively).
And my approach is to preform switch that maintain the valid state.
So I'll start with just filling as much teachers as I can, then using legal valid swaps I would eventually end up with solution.
And what's great about this method is that it already implement an editing algorithm, meaning when I eventually give the user a solution he/she can customize it how ever they like
