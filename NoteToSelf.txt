Remove scrollbar
and an install pwa button/ shortcut  <------still urgent currently working on it.
then Imma be done with the front end.
start the table screen in coordination with the back end which is a course in code ninja or default google channel cuz they also us typescript


-->only render ( update the changed cells ) understand props change relation with render method



for a group of cells take intersection teachers and consider them as one and take their added periods and the non repeating intersection of their available list and apply the standard metric.
1. we need a lot of memory complexity to reduce the nessesary amount of prossesing power.
2. I need to learn about async and await.
3. apply a stack structure both for Undo and when the Async function return an issue so that user changes must be reverted and nessesry changes applied
4. figure out an upper bound to the length of the sup sets so that you don't do an n-1xn-1 "massive" subset 2s , 3s ... N's
